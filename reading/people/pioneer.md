  - 研究者发现，在很多领域，需要深耕 10 年，才能成为专家
  - The key is *deliberative* practice: not just doing it again and again, but challenging yourself with a task that is just beyond your current ability, trying it, analyzing your performance while and after doing it, and correcting any mistakes.
  - How to become a real programmer:
